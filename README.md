What is Breathing Earth?
-------------

*Breathing Earth is an open-source visualization of GPS data to demonstrate
the effects of precipitation, land saturation and cyclical movement of the
Earth's surface. In the winter months, precipitation saturates the ground,
making the ground heavy, and pushing it down. Then, in the summer, water
evaporates, removing the heavy water and causing lift. Other events also
affect the Earth's surface, such as Earthquakes, oil pumping and mining operations.
