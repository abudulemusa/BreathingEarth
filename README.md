What is Breathing Earth?
-------------

Breathing Earth is an open-source visualization of how ground height changes over time.  

We use high precision GPS vertical position estimates to visualize changes in ground height due to precipitation, earthquakes, tectonics, glacial melt, as well as human induced water/oil and gas pumping. Stay tuned for a complete write up of this project at geodesygina.com.

Take a look, visit our site and enjoy!
