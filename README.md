How to run locally?
1. Install npm and nodejs
2. run this command to get http-server installed
    - npm install http-server -g
    * the g installs globally, so you can run servers from any folder for demo or test
3. After it is installed, navigate to the site folder where you have index.html
4. Open terminal and run http-server
5. This will start a local http-server to which you can open your browser and, by default on port 8080, you should see the site!

Disclaimer: You will need to get a google maps API key if you dont have one and add it into the bottom of index.html
